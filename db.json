At present, the highest-end Core i7 processor is the ninth-generation Intel Core i7-9700K. This processor has a 3.6GHz CPU frequency and a maximum core frequency of 4.9GHz, which is only 5.0GHz after the i9-9900K and i7-9700K. The number of core threads is 8 cores and 8 threads, which has two more physical cores than the previous generation i7, and is more focused on the game field. The Intel Core i7-9700K processor is obviously more suitable for gaming, and even comparable to the 8-core 16-thread 5.0GHz i9-9900K in gaming performance. And since the number of i7-9700K cores has reached 8 physical cores, it means that games and most applications can be fully satisfied.</p>\r\n<p>The 9th-generation Core that was launched this time also used brazing for heat dissipation, and the Intel Core i7-9700K is no exception. The brazing heat dissipation efficiency is significantly higher than that of silicone grease. This is a liquid metal heat dissipation material with very high heat dissipation efficiency. It can easily withstand the pressure of high-load applications and ensure that the Intel Core i7-9700K can run for a long time. At super high Turbo frequency. In terms of price, the price of this processor is 339 pounds. It also needs to be equipped with high-quality power supply, motherboard and heat dissipation. Many people cannot afford it.
